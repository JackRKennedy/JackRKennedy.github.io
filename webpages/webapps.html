<h2>Webapps and calculators</h2>
<br></br>
<p>Nothing spectacularly interesting here, but the below are personal calculators or apps ive built that exist on my desktop, that I would like to share</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="../webapps/dots_calculator/dots_calculator.html">Dots Calculator</a> - This is used to calculate what total you need to lift to achieve a certain dots score, particularly useful when aiming for qualification dots scores in competition, it removes the guess work and multiple inputs of potential totals on other calculators to get the desired dots score</li>
    <li><a href="../webapps/Morsecode/morse_code_translator.html">Morse Code Translator</a> - Serves a very niche purpose, does what it says on the tin, just wanted to experiment with something weird that I had no prior knowledge of</li>
</ul>
