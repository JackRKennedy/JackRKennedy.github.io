        <li><strong>Project 1: Chess Game using Avalonia UI and C#</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>I have been playing chess for about 6 months, I have seen some improvement, but I thought building a chess game with its own chess engine would help me build knowledge of how a board should be evaluated, deepening my understanding of the game.</li>
            <li>The desktop is developed more so like a windows form, but since my programming is all done in the macOS environment, I needed to use Avalonia UI and JetBrains Rider as it was the best IDE for the environment.</li>
            <li>So far, I have written the basics of the rules, helped massively by ChatGPT and tutorials from YouTube -> these include all the basics (and newest moves such as En Passant and Castling).</li>
            <li>The next step in this project is the chess engine itself, which I am actively researching. I would like this to include an evaluation bar similar to a certain famous chess website, that displays in real time during the game, helping me see my mistakes LIVE.</li>
            <li>I would also like to have the ability to load positions using FEN notation, so that I can implement an analysis mode (where you try to guess as close as possible to the computer's evaluation) or similarly, a puzzle mode.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Project 2: Typing Test Desktop App using Avalonia UI and C#</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Very little to report here so far, I have the basic window working, but I am still deciding on how I would like this to be displayed.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Project 3: A dots calculator for powerlifting</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Using the IPF formulas found <a href="https://www.powerlifting.sport/rules/codes/info/ipf-formula">here</a> -> this is different from calculators you find online, as it instead tells you what total you have to hit at whatever bodyweight to achieve a desired dots score, which is particularly useful for qualifying for invite-only events.</li>
        </ul>
