        <!-- Bio -->
        <p>Hello, I'm Jack Kennedy, an energetic and detail-oriented financial services professional who recently moved to Sydney and is looking for work. With a strong foundation in biomedical engineering and mathematics, I excel in improving internal processes and creating effective automations for teams. My technical proficiency spans across key programming languages such as Python, SQL, and C#, and I'm actively pursuing certifications in Data Analytics and IT Automation with Python from Google.</p>

        <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
        <p>At <strong>TRAction Fintech Pty Ltd</strong>, I increased processing efficiency by writing and improving SQL scripts to fix data errors, developed multiple Excel/VBA macros to automate repetitive tasks, and designed custom Python scripts for data pre-processing. Additionally, I implemented a custom ChatGPT model for lead qualification, automating the collection of company websites, directors' lists, and brief histories to assess potential client suitability.</p>
        <p>While at the <strong>Maples Group</strong>, I was responsible for monitoring trade loads, preparing regulatory reports, and supporting global teams. I automated trade loading processes using keystone and C# scripting and developed reconciliation templates using FundRecs.</p>
        <p>At <strong>SEI Dublin</strong>, I maintained comprehensive data records, processed investor trade files, and delivered accurate client/investor reports. I trained junior analysts, developed client procedures, and optimized team relationships with large hedge fund clients.</p>

        <h2>Skills and Technologies</h2>
        <p>In addition to Python, SQL, and C#, I am proficient in Microsoft Excel/VBA, Microsoft SQL Server, Geneva/Investran, Calastone/Keystone, Service Now, Bloomberg Terminal, and FundRecs.</p>

        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>Programming is a passion of mine, and I am currently working on a chess game using C# with JetBrains Rider IDE and Avalonia UI. My goal is to build my own chess engine and position evaluation feature that can be entered into chess-bot tournaments.</p>
        <p>As an athlete, I have trained and competed in powerlifting, achieving runner-up at the 2023 IrishPF September open in the -120kg weight class with a 240kg squat and deadlift. I am also an avid rugby player and currently training in Muay Thai, with plans to start Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu soon.</p>
