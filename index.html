  <!-- Bio -->
  <p>Hello, I'm Jack Kennedy, an energetic and detail-oriented financial services professional who recently moved to Sydney and is looking for work. With a strong foundation in biomedical engineering and mathematics, I excel in improving internal processes and creating effective automations for teams. My technical proficiency spans across key programming languages such as Python, SQL, and C#, and I'm actively pursuing certifications in Data Analytics and IT Automation with Python from Google.</p>
  <p>My professional journey includes significant roles in data cleansing, transaction processing, and client support, where I've consistently demonstrated a commitment to leveraging technology to solve complex problems. Notable achievements include increasing processing efficiency through improved SQL scripts, developing Excel/VBA macros to automate repetitive tasks, and designing custom Python scripts for data pre-processing. Additionally, I have contributed to innovative solutions such as a custom ChatGPT model for lead qualification, showcasing my ability to integrate technology seamlessly into business operations.</p>
  <p>I hold a degree in Biomedical Engineering from Trinity College Dublin and bring a wealth of experience from roles at the Maples Group and SEI Dublin. Beyond my professional interests, I am passionate about programming, chess, powerlifting, and Muay Thai. Currently, I'm working on a chess game using C#, aiming to build a chess engine and position evaluation feature for chess-bot tournaments.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/JackRKennedy">GitHub</a></li>
    <li><strong>Project 1: Chess Game using Avalonia UI and C#</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>I have been playing chess for about 6 months, I have seen some improvement, but I thought building a chess game with its own chess engine would help me build knowledge of how a board should be evaluated, deepening my understanding of the game.</li>
      <li>The desktop is developed more so like a windows form, but since my programming is all done in the macOS environment, I needed to use Avalonia UI and JetBrains Rider as it was the best IDE for the environment.</li>
      <li>So far, I have written the basics of the rules, helped massively by ChatGPT and tutorials from YouTube -> these include all the basics (and newest moves such as En Passant and Castling).</li>
      <li>The next step in this project is the chess engine itself, which I am actively researching. I would like this to include an evaluation bar similar to a certain famous chess website, that displays in real time during the game, helping me see my mistakes LIVE.</li>
      <li>I would also like to have the ability to load positions using FEN notation, so that I can implement an analysis mode (where you try to guess as close as possible to the computer's evaluation) or similarly, a puzzle mode.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Project 2: Typing Test Desktop App using Avalonia UI and C#</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Very little to report here so far, I have the basic window working, but I am still deciding on how I would like this to be displayed.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Project 3: A dots calculator for powerlifting</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the IPF formulas found <a href="https://www.powerlifting.sport/rules/codes/info/ipf-formula">here</a> -> this is different from calculators you find online, as it instead tells you what total you have to hit at whatever bodyweight to achieve a desired dots score, which is particularly useful for qualifying for invite-only events.</li>
    </ul>
