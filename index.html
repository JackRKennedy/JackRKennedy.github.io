  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <!-- Add your bio here -->
  <p><Hello, I'm Jack Kennedy, an energetic and detail-oriented financial services professional who recently moved to Sydney and is looking for work. With a strong foundation in biomedical engineering and mathematics, I excel in improving internal processes and creating effective automations for teams. My technical proficiency spans across key programming languages such as Python, SQL, and C#, and I'm actively pursuing certifications in Data Analytics and IT Automation with Python from Google.

    My professional journey includes significant roles in data cleansing, transaction processing, and client support, where I've consistently demonstrated a commitment to leveraging technology to solve complex problems. Notable achievements include increasing processing efficiency through improved SQL scripts, developing Excel/VBA macros to automate repetitive tasks, and designing custom Python scripts for data pre-processing. Additionally, I have contributed to innovative solutions such as a custom ChatGPT model for lead qualification, showcasing my ability to integrate technology seamlessly into business operations.

    I hold a degree in Biomedical Engineering from Trinity College Dublin and bring a wealth of experience from roles at the Maples Group and SEI Dublin. Beyond my professional interests, I am passionate about programming, chess, powerlifting, and Muay Thai. Currently, I'm working on a chess game using C#, aiming to build a chess engine and position evaluation feature for chess-bot tournaments.</p>
