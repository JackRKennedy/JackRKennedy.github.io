    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to my "website!" - Here I am going to display some of my
      projects that I have been working on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although there isn't much here yet, I am just getting started
      (this is actually my first website!) so bare with me, but expect to see some very poorly tested features, including some form validation, a contact form, and some calculators I use on a regular basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Keep an eye on my <a href="https://github.com/JackRKennedy" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
      for any projects or code im proud of, I will hopefully start making some repos in no time ! &#128513;
    </p>

    <p>Right now, my focus is on learning code that interests me, it seems like a lot at times as it currently involves languages likes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and more. But I am enjoying the process and I am excited to see where it takes me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am doing most of my learning on Codecademy, I am enrolled in the full stack engineering path (which has been very challenging so far) - but I've really loved it. 

      I'm also enrolled in the Business Intelligence Data Analyst course, where we are focusing on SQL and Python. I am really enjoying this course as well, and I am excited to see where it takes me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some other fun facts about me: I am Irish, I love sports and fitness and both compete
      and coach in powerlifting (both hobbies I picked up this year)
      and I can solve a Rubik's cube in <em>about</em> 45 seconds on average.

      I'm now also a qualified personal trainer, and have moed ot Sydney with my girlfriend!
